## API Integration
CookSnap leverages the Edamam Recipe Search API. Update the API credentials in `script.js` if needed:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.edamam.com/search?q=${searchValue}&app_id=YOUR_APP_ID&app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY&from=0&to=10`);
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_APP_KEY` with your own API credentials from [Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com/).
